"""Automatic bottleneck detection for multi-agent skill evolution.

Analyzes a quality report to classify failures by source agent, then
recommends which agent(s) to evolve. Prevents wasted evolution cycles
on the wrong agent.

Agent names are loaded dynamically from agent_registry.json via tools.py.

Usage:
    from agents.workflow.skill_evolution_agent.bottleneck import detect_bottleneck

    result = detect_bottleneck(report, client, model_id)
    # result.recommendation = "<agent_name>" | "both" | "none"
    # result.routing_failures = [...], result.skill_failures = [...]

_CLASSIFIER_TEMPLATE = """\
You are a failure classifier for a multi-agent system. The system has:
{agent_list}

You receive a failed conversation and must classify the failure source.

IMPORTANT: Prefer ROUTING_FAILURE or SKILL_FAILURE over TOOL_FAILURE or
ARCHITECTURE_FAILURE. Most failures are fixable by improving agent skills
or routing. Only use TOOL_FAILURE when the tool returned demonstrably
wrong data. Only use ARCHITECTURE_FAILURE for genuine infrastructure
issues (timeouts, crashes, state corruption).

Classification categories:

ROUTING_FAILURE: The routing agent made a bad decision. Signals:
- Routing agent answered a question directly instead of delegating to a sub-agent
- Routing agent sent the question to the wrong sub-agent
- Agent answered from "own knowledge" instead of using available tools
- Response says "I don't have access to" when the tool exists
- Agent provided generic info when specific data was available via tools
- Agent declined or refused a question that it could have answered

SKILL_FAILURE: A sub-agent received the question but its skill/instructions
were insufficient. This is the MOST COMMON failure type. Signals:
- Agent used the tool but with wrong keyword or topic mapping
- Agent got tool results but misinterpreted or ignored them
- Agent failed to handle edge cases (synonyms, implicit topics)
- Agent gave correct first answer but failed on follow-ups
- Agent's response was vague, incomplete, or lacked specifics
- Agent hallucinated facts instead of using the tool
- Tool doesn't cover the topic — the skill should teach graceful handling
- Agent did not know how to phrase the tool query

TOOL_FAILURE: The tool itself returned wrong data despite correct usage.
This is RARE. Only classify as TOOL_FAILURE when:
- The tool was called with the correct topic/keyword AND returned wrong data
- NOT when the agent called the tool with the wrong keyword (that's SKILL)
- NOT when the tool has no data for a topic (that's SKILL — handle gracefully)

ARCHITECTURE_FAILURE: Systemic infrastructure issue. This is RARE. Only when:
- Multi-turn state was genuinely lost (not just poor follow-up handling)
- Conversation timed out or crashed
- NOT when the agent just handled a multi-turn question poorly (that's SKILL)

Output format (JSON):
{{
  "classification": "ROUTING_FAILURE" | "SKILL_FAILURE" | "TOOL_FAILURE" | "ARCHITECTURE_FAILURE",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "evidence": "one sentence explaining why",
